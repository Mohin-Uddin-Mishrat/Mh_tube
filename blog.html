                    it is declared. And they are not hoisted to the top of their scop , that means the variables can not be used before their declaration. <br>

                <P>
                    Null :: if a function expects an object as an argument and an object is not available, you might pass null to indicate the absence of an object. <br>
                    You might set a variable to null to indicate that it should no longer hold a specific value.
                    <br> <br>
                    undefined :: When a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are set to undefined.<br>
                    Accessing a property that doesn't exist on an object returns undefined.
